# HandwrittenFonts

While in college I took a class called Software Engineering I. The goal of this class was to reach software engineering principals while working as a team.

For this assignment we were tasked with developing a program our professor could use for his other, lower level computer classes. The program was designed to recognize a users hand writing and convert it into a useable font.

While we were unsuccessful in the final piece of converting it to an actual font file, we did successfully write a piece that demonstrated the data we had could be re-constructed to show the original handwriting digitally.
